****MongoDB CRUD API for Book Management**

This project provides a RESTful API for managing books using MongoDB as the database. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books. Users can add new books, view a list of all books, view details of a specific book by its ID, update a book's details, and delete a book.

**Technologies Used**
1.Node.js
2.Express.js
3.MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
4.RESTful API principles
5.Git & GitHub for version control

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-  Node.js: Download & Install Node.js
-  MongoDB: Download & Install MongoDB

**Getting Started**

**Installing Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:
  - npm install

**Setting Up MongoDB**

1.Install and run MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas.
2.Create a new database named bookstore.
3.Update the MongoDB connection URI in the config.js file with your database connection details.

**Running the Application**

  -  Start the application using the following command:
  - npm start

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/api/books.

**API Endpoints**

  -  POST /api/books: Add a new book (requires 'title', 'author', and 'summary' in the request body).
  -  GET /api/books: Retrieve a list of all books.
  -  GET /api/books/:id: Retrieve details of a specific book by its ID.
  -  PUT /api/books/:id: Update details of a specific book by its ID.
  -  DELETE /api/books/:id: Delete a specific book by its ID.

**Usage Examples**

1.Adding a New Book:

    POST /api/books
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "title": "Sample Book",
      "author": "John Doe",
      "summary": "This is a sample book summary."
    }

2.Getting List of Books:
    GET /api/books/:id
    
3.Getting Details of a Book:
    GET /api/books/:id
    **Replace ':id' with the actual ID of the book you want to retrieve.**
    
4.Updating a Book:
    PUT /api/books/:id
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "title": "Updated Book Title",
      "author": "Jane Smith",
      "summary": "This is the updated book summary."
    }
  **Replace ':id' with the actual ID of the book you want to update.**
  
5.Deleting a Book:
    DELETE /api/books/:id
  **Replace :id with the actual ID of the book you want to delete**

**Additional Comments:**

1. Error Handling: Describe how errors are handled in the API, including the types of error responses that users can expect and how they should handle errors in their applications.

2. Scalability: If the project is designed to handle a large number of users or data, mention any considerations made for scalability, such as database sharding, load balancing, or caching strategies.

3. Security: Specify any security measures implemented in the API, such as encryption of sensitive data, authentication mechanisms, and authorization checks for different endpoints.

4. Performance: Mention any performance optimizations applied, such as database indexing, query optimizations, or caching techniques, to ensure smooth and efficient API responses.

5. Logging and Monitoring: Discuss the logging mechanisms in place, including what information is logged (e.g., requests, errors) and how developers can access and analyze the logs. Mention any monitoring tools used for tracking API performance.

**Project Assumptions:**

1. Data Validity: Assume that incoming data for CRUD operations is validated at the client-side or through API input validation. Specify that the API relies on properly formatted data for successful operations.

2. Authentication: Specify if the API assumes that users are authenticated before accessing certain endpoints. If authentication is required, mention the type of authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT tokens, API keys) assumed for securing API endpoints.

3. Authorization: Specify if certain endpoints have restricted access and assume that users or clients have the necessary permissions to perform actions like updating or deleting records.

4. Environment Assumptions: Mention any assumptions about the deployment environment, such as the operating system, network configurations, or dependencies that need to be installed on the host system.

5. Concurrency: Specify how the API handles concurrent requests and if any concurrency control mechanisms, such as database transactions, are assumed to be in place.

6. Data Backup: If the API assumes regular data backups, mention the backup frequency and the process for restoring data in case of failures.
